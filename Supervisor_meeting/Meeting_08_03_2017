Corrections:
	Pipe -> three terms -> liniar inductor, unlinear resistor, voltage source caused by gravity.
	Collect components in table 4.2


sudden pressure drops = air in pipes

parameter estimations:
	inertia parameters are well know -> calculate them!
	Estimate Kv for valves -> resitance term
	Estimate resistance for pipes by joining the unlinar termes and estimate them as one aka Kp. 
	Estimate one resitance term for each component. 
	Kp more or less constant -> assume not flow dependent. 
	Tom will send pump "a" parameters. 
	only use stedystate measurements as trasient behavior aka iniertia is assumed known. 

Step:
	Open consumers valves fully, obtain operating point.

	0.3 m^3 pr. hour enduser flow operating point
	operating point suggestion 0.09 bar.
