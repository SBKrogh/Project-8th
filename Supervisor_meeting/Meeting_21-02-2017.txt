water tower = pressure defined by tank
water tower = pressure control
typical use, only 1 meter tower hight used to maintain almost constant pressure. 
water quality add to problem statement
F_res express as gravitational statement instead.
remove eq 3.23
newton second law -> derive tank model
start by lokking at basic pipe model 
tank = capacitor -> flow integrator 
send stuff latest Wednesday the 1.
nex meeting friday the 3. marts
