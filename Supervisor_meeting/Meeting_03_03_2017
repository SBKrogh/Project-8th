Keep "valve-pump-valve" combo as one component. 
H*q=d 
H*q-d=0
d=inflow / outflow vector of system -> must sum to zero

Triangular tank pressure = vertical tank pressure -> only dependent on water elevation. 

Add water tower expression as an additional state (differential expression)

Parameter estimation.
assume = volume of pipe is correct 
estimate only resistance parameters
close the tank and estimate without
conduct steady state analysis.  
Do not estimate on component level
Estimation on subsystem level could have advantages. 

Flow measurements should be done by estimation based on pressure measurements when valve is fully open. 

Normal units:
flow = m^3/hour
pressure = bar


Flow constraint of tank:
Adjust according to end user flow.

If tool can handle unlinear system, estimate unlinear model

Model predictive control -> only for linear models


To do:
Get model predictive control book! [Mac02] J. M. Maciejowski. Predictive Control with Constraints. Prentice-Hall, 2002.
Play with the system
