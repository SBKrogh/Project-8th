kirchhofs laws -> clearify that we use equavalents not the actual voltage lav!
clearify menaing of section "parameter estimation" -> Model for parameter estimation.
clearify section "parameter estimation" can not follow the use of KCL and KVL
prove equation 4.53
clearify the origion of 4.54 something with "tilde i or j"

be explicit with equations wenn possible.


Operating point shall be obtained with tank!
parameter estimation of the unlinear parameters can be done without the tank!


to be sure on flow, full open or closed valve

filtering FIR 5 samnples

pump full speed = 1
make sure to operate pump inside feasible region
